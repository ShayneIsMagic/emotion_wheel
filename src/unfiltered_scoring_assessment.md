## Enhanced Mathematical Scoring System

### Individual Assessment Scoring
**Raw Selection Method**: User selects all emotions experienced in specified timeframe

**Base Calculation**:
```
Family Score = Σ(Selected Emotion Values) / Total Possible Family Score × 100

Example: Joy Family
- User selects: Serenity (1), Pleasure (2), Joy (3) = 6 points
- Total possible Joy family score = 15 points (sum of all 5 levels)
- Joy Family Score = 6/15 × 100 = 40.0%
```

**Combination Emotion Detection**:
```
If user selects both Joy (3) and Trust (3):
- Love combination = 6 points
- Combination bonus = +1 point
- Total combination score = 7 points
```

### Overall Profile Calculation
```
Total Emotional Range = Number of families with selections (0-8)
Average Intensity = Mean score of all selected emotions
Complexity Index = Number of combination emotions identified
Balance Coefficient = 100 - (Polar opposite conflict score × 10)
Combination Sophistication = Sum of all combination emotion scores

Composite Score = (Range × 12.5) + (Average Intensity × 5) + (Complexity × 2) + 
                 (Balance) + (Combination Sophistication × 0.5)
Maximum possible score = 250
```

### Polar Opposite Conflict Scoring
When opposite emotions are selected:
- **Joy + Sadness**: Conflict penalty = -10 points
- **Trust + Disgust**: Conflict penalty = -10 points  
- **Fear + Anger**: Conflict penalty = -10 points
- **Surprise + Anticipation**: Conflict penalty = -10 points

**Conflict Intensity Multiplier**:
- Level 1-2 conflicts: ×1 penalty
- Level 3 conflicts: ×1.5 penalty
- Level 4-5 conflicts: ×2 penalty

### Enhanced Pattern Recognition Metrics

**Granularity Score by Family** (0-5 scale):
- 0 emotions selected = 0 points (Void)
- 1-2 emotions selected = 1 point (Minimal)  
- 3-5 emotions selected = 2 points (Low)
- 6-8 emotions selected = 3 points (Moderate)
- 9-12 emotions selected = 4 points (High)
- 13+ emotions selected = 5 points (Maximum)

**Intensity Distribution Analysis**:
- Peak-heavy (>50% selections in Level 4-5 range): **Dysregulation Flag**
- Balanced across ranges: **Regulation Indicator**  
- Low-only (<50% selections in Level 1-2 range): **Suppression Flag**
- Missing intensity ranges: **Gap Indicator**
- Combination-heavy (>30% combination emotions): **Complexity Flag**

**Combination Emotion Analysis**:
- **Primary combinations present**: Basic emotional complexity
- **Secondary combinations present**: Advanced emotional sophistication
- **Missing combinations**: Potential emotional rigidity
- **Over-representation**: Possible emotional complexity or dysregulation

## Enhanced Implementation Notes

### Data Collection Method
1. Present all 8 emotion families with 5 intensity levels each
2. User selects all applicable emotions (no limits)
3. Automatic combination detection based on selections
4. Secondary combination identification for advanced users
5. Mathematical processing of raw data with combination bonuses

### Scoring Objectivity
- No clinical interpretation applied to scores
- No personality correlation assumptions
- Pure mathematical relationship calculations
- Pattern recognition without subjective labels
- Data-driven flag system only
- Combination emotion scoring based on mathematical relationships

### Enhanced Limitations Acknowledged
- Self-report bias inherent in all selections  
- No temporal consistency validation
- Mathematical model may not reflect psychological reality
- Scoring system based on theoretical intensity assignments
- Combination emotion formulas require empirical validation
- Secondary combinations are theoretical constructs
