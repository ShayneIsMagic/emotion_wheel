## Enhanced Assessment Framework

### Administration Protocol

**Setting**: Private, distraction-free clinical environment
**Time**: 45-60 minutes including discussion
**Materials**: Assessment form, clinical scoring sheet, interpretation guide

**Instructions to Client**:
*"I'm going to present you with detailed emotion words organized into eight categories representing different ways people experience and describe emotions. Each category has five intensity levels, from subtle background feelings to very intense experiences. For each category, I'd like you to select the words that describe emotions you've experienced with some regularity over the past month - not just once, but recurring patterns. Don't overthink it; if a word resonates with your recent emotional experience, select it. We'll also explore how these emotions combine to create more complex emotional experiences."*
